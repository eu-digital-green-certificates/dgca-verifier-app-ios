## About

This repository contains the source code of the EU Digital COVID Certificate Verifier App for iOS.

The DGC Verifier Apps are responsible for scanning and verifying DGCs using public keys from national backend servers. Offline verification is supported, if the latest public keys are present in the app's key store. Consequently, once up-to-date keys have been downloaded, the verification works without active internet connection.

**A note on using the apps and released APK files found in this GitHub organization**: The apps are reference implementations that cannot be used in production environments as-is, but rather need to be configured by EU member states to access their national backends.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- You need a Mac to run Xcode.
- Xcode 12.5+ is used for our builds. The OS requirement is macOS 11.0+.
- To install development apps on physical iPhones, you need an Apple Developer account.
- Service Endpoints:
  - This App talks to the pubkey endpoint: `https://dgca-verifier-service.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`,
  - Or anotherone specified as serverURI in `DGCAVerifier/Services/GatewayConnection.swift`.
  - To get QR Codes for testing, you might want to check out `https://dgc.a-sit.at/ehn/testsuite`.

### Build

Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

#### Xcode based build


Important Info: SPM and the SwiftDGC [core module](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-app-core-ios)
- Depending on the development status, this module might be either linked locally or via github URL.
- If it's linked locally, you should clone both repos into the same folder:
- `<project folder>`
    - `dgca-app-core-ios`
    - `dgca-verifier-app-ios`
- Otherwise it will be pulled by Xcode like all other SPM modules.
    - Make sure the core module is up to date by clicking File > Swift Packages > Update Packages.

Build steps
- Set the development team to any Apple Developer Account
- Give the project a unique bundle identifier
- Install swift package manager requirements through Xcode 12.5+
- Build and run the project through Xcode 12.5+
